## I am NOT a cybersecurity professional. Why use Netlas.io to search the internet?

The platform was originally created for cybersecurity professionals and developers. 

But sometimes it can be useful to anyone who needs to find something on the Internet, but can't do it with Google.  Netlas.io allows you to search many sites that are not indexed by regular search engines (this can be due to the presence of a ban on indexing in the robots.txt file). 


In addition, Netlas.io allows you to find older, possibly defunct, versions of websites by using a search function to search through scans of different dates.
